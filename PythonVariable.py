# What is variable?
# A varibale simply means that little change in your program by holding something like value
# Do not have to declare the data type in python as it's dynamic language
x = 'Dogs'
print(x)
x = '23321' # Python enough to smart as recognized the variable data type
print(x)
# Python is dynamic language, just bkz no need to declare like any other language. It's strongly typed
# as the interpreter keeps track of all variable types.
